Only code that has my signature was implemented by me. Template and other classes were provided by SFU.

## MainGUI

A program that uses the implemented shape classes to draw shapes using cells on a graphical user interface.

## MazeGUI

A program that uses the implemented UI classes to visualize a maze that I generate using a depth first search algorithm.
